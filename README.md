# Percolation Project

This project simulates a percolation system using an N x N grid.  
It also includes statistical analysis with Monte Carlo simulations.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Percolation simulation on a grid
- Monte Carlo statistics
- Robust error handling
- Optimized Union-Find implementation
- Unit tests with JUnit 5

## ðŸ“¦ Build & Run

### Compile
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run Tests
```bash
mvn test
```
